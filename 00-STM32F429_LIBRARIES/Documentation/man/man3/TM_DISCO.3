\fBSelect your board\fP
.RS 4
To select your board, you have several options:
.IP "\(bu" 2
Add define for your board in defines\&.h file or
.IP "\(bu" 2
Add define for your board in compiler's global settings
.IP "  \(bu" 4
For Keil uVision you have 'Options for Target' and 'C/C++' tab where you can set this\&.

Imagine, we want to work with STM324x9-Eval board\&. Then, you can open \fCdefines\&.h\fP file and add define: 
.PP
.nf
//Select STM324x9-Eval for DISCO library
#define TM_DISCO_STM324x9_EVAL

.fi
.PP
 Or if you want STM32F429-Discovery, do this: 
.PP
.nf
//Select STM32F429-Discovery for DISCO library
#define TM_DISCO_STM32F429_DISCOVERY

.fi
